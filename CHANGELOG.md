# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Host adapters
- Added **Kimi plugin adapter**: root `kimi.plugin.json` manifest exposing all six skills under the `hikmah-stack:*` namespace, with routing guidance for the host. No changes to the existing OpenAI/Codex or Claude Code adapters.

## 3.0.0 - 2026-08-09

### Cognitive architecture
- Added **Hikmah Cognitive Kernel**, a deterministic Rust co-model runtime independent of transformer/neural hidden state.
- Added **TraceWeave** typed memory with hash-chained append-only provenance, dynamic multi-channel recall, redundancy suppression, structured conflicts, deadlines, and correction/supersession.
- Added parallel evidence, memory, risk, human-impact, and delivery deliberation lanes.
- Added deterministic multi-criteria decision evaluation with evidence-coverage penalties and hard blocks.
- Added model-agnostic `ProposalEngine` boundary for local, remote, symbolic, state-space, neural, or future proposal systems.

### Playbooks and lenses
- Added remember/recall/consolidate, parallel-deliberation, and error-to-learning playbooks.
- Added memory-integrity, model-independence, and human-memory-inspiration lenses.
- Integrated persistent memory and outcome learning directly into Operator Core, Agent Radar, Decision Forge, Ship Guard, and Hikmah Orchestrator.

### Research and assurance
- Added human-memory research notes, co-model architecture, memory architecture, and evaluation contract.
- Added an explicit no-perfect-engine rule: guarantees, heuristics, empirical evidence, and limitations must be separated.
- Rust Truth Gate is now primary; Python remains only a zero-install compatibility fallback.

## 2.0.0 - 2026-08-09

### Breaking
- Renamed the project from Wisdom Lens to **Hikmah Stack**.
- Renamed public skills: `wisdom-playbook` → `operator-core`, `new-lens` → `agent-radar`, `decision-engine` → `decision-forge`, `builder-protocol` → `ship-guard`.
- Renamed `wisdom-advisor` to `hikmah-orchestrator`.

### Added
- Native OpenAI `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` packaging for ChatGPT/Codex.
- Portable `hikmah-orchestrator` skill for hosts without Claude-style subagents.
- Codex command-based Truth Gate and host-specific hook separation.
- Repo-scoped OpenAI marketplace metadata.
- Compatibility, architecture, ethics, governance, CI, and validation documentation.

### Changed
- Corrected maintainer identity to Juber Shaikh.
- Reframed unsafe capacity language to acknowledge real human constraints.
- Kept empirical AI statistics in dated evidence notes rather than core doctrine.

## 1.1.0 - 2026-08-09
- Hardened the original package for open-source release, added evidence notes, licensing, contribution/security files, and a single completion quality gate.
